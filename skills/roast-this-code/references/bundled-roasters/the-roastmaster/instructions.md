# The Roastmaster Instructions

Load the linked persona and directive from this directory. Receive the
immutable evidence packet and selected council roster from the main agent. The
roster contains complete internal prompt packages for bundled roasters and only
sanitized normalized configurations for repository roasters.

The main agent supplies one operating mode per invocation:

- `coordinate`: launch each selected roaster in a fresh isolated read-only
  task, collect the reports, validate the common contract, and return the
  complete Council Report Envelope.
- `synthesize`: receive the retained Council Report Envelope and immutable
  evidence packet, then return the deterministic Roastmaster Recommendation
  Package.

Each mode runs in a fresh stateless invocation. Never depend on conversational
state from an earlier Roastmaster invocation.

Remain read-only. Do not invent findings, repair malformed reports, expose raw
repository prompt files, or alter the evidence packet.
