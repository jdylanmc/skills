# Roast This Agent

`roast-this-agent` runs the shared Artifact Roastmaster over one agent
definition and the prompt files it explicitly links. The Artifact Roastmaster
stages that evidence as immutable, launches independent read-only roasters,
verifies their evidence, deduplicates root causes, and returns one
severity-ranked Artifact Roast. The reviewed agent is never invoked.

## Who this is for

- **Review users** point the skill at one agent file before shipping it and
  decide whether to ship, revise, or reroute the work.
- **Agent maintainers** read the roast to locate the exact file, the
  consequence, the bounded fix, and the validation that proves the fix.

The report assumes familiarity with this repository's agent format. It never
edits, commits, publishes, or comments on anything.

## Terms

- **Roaster** — one independent read-only reviewer instance that applies
  exactly one lens and returns one Artifact Roaster Report.
- **Lens** — the bounded set of review dimensions a roaster applies.
- **Council** — the selected roasters for one run. Maximum five: two mandatory
  and up to three evidence-triggered specialists.
- **Evidence packet** — the immutable staged evidence for one run, named by one
  packet identifier and described by one file manifest with digests.
- **Trusted lens document** — a read-only source of review principles, either a
  coach agent file or a bundled lens configuration. Never invoked.
- **Doctrine** — shared engineering best-practice files loaded only through a
  trusted doctrine manifest. Doctrine guides recommendations and never proves a
  defect.

## Installation

The canonical layout is this skills repository:

```text
agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md
agents/skill-coach.agent.md
agents/prompt-coach.agent.md
agents/ste-coach.agent.md
doctrine/manifest.md
skills/roast-this-agent/
```

Install this repository, or copy this package with the sibling `skills/_base/`
directory while preserving those paths. The Artifact Roastmaster coordinator
must be present in `agents/` or `.github/agents/`. Repository coach agents are
preferred but optional because the verified bundled lens configurations provide
the final fallback. This package vendors no coordinator or coach agent.

Shared doctrine may be absent, which is a supported state recorded as
`Doctrine status: unavailable`. Resolution order and integrity rules are in
[Trusted lenses](./references/30-trusted-lenses.md).

## Package layout

```

## Maintenance

After editing `references/30-trusted-lenses.md`, regenerate its digest and
update the matching entry in `references/trusted-manifest.md`:

```bash
shasum -a 256 skills/roast-this-agent/references/30-trusted-lenses.md
```

A run records `Lens drift` when a coach agent in `agents/` no longer matches the
bundled lens configuration in `references/30-trusted-lenses.md`. That is the
trigger to refresh the matching lens section and regenerate its digest with the
command above.

The same maintenance rule applies to the sibling packages `roast-this-skill`
and `roast-this-prompt`.
