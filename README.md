# Common Copilot Skills

This repository is a personal library of reusable GitHub Copilot skills and agents for day-to-day work.

## Layout

```text

  <id>.doctrine.md
skills/

    _atoms/
      <atom-name>/
        <atom-name>.md
        <atom-name>.mjs
        <atom-name>.test.mjs
    _molecules/
      <molecule-name>/

        <molecule-name>.mjs

    SKILL.md
    references/
      <supporting-instructions>.md
```

`SKILL.md` is the canonical entry point for every skill. Supporting instructions belong beside it under `references/` and are linked from the skill.

Non-routable shared units live under `skills/_base/` in level namespaces. A unit
is exactly one Markdown file inside a same-named unit root, and its composition
level is derived from its path: `_atoms/` holds atoms and `_molecules/` holds
molecules.

An **atom** is one single operation judged from the caller's point of view. It
references no other unit and declares `includes: []`. A **molecule** composes
two or more atoms or molecules by reference to produce one bounded outcome. A
**skill** is the only unit that may be invoked directly: the contract the agent
understands.

A level namespace contains one same-named root directory per unit. Each unit
root is flat, contains only regular files, and never contains symbolic links. A
support file beside a unit is named after that unit, so `chronicler.mjs` and
`chronicler.adversarial.test.mjs` both belong beside `chronicler.md` in
`_molecules/chronicler/`, and a unit may include only its own local support
files. Unit composition and code dependency are separate graphs: the unit graph
runs strictly downward and is enforced, while a unit's local script may import
another unit's script so that shared implementation is written once.

Nothing under `_base` uses `SKILL.md`. These units are read by the skills that
compose them and are never routed to, listed as a skill, or invoked directly.

## Dependency Mirror

A Markdown file opts in to dependency validation by declaring `includes` in its
frontmatter. `includes` is a JSON array of skills-root-relative paths that
mirrors exactly the local links in that file's `## Required References` or
`## Required Files` section. `requires-skills` is a JSON array of routable
skill dependencies, each `{"id": "<skill-name>", "source": "local" | "external",
"required": true | false}`.

```yaml
---
includes: ["_base/common/BASE.md", "example/references/a.md", "example/scripts/run.mjs"]
requires-skills: [{"id": "handoff", "source": "external", "required": true}]
---
```

Rules the validator enforces:

- Both fields are single-line JSON. Block-style YAML lists are not accepted.
- The mirror covers every local link in a required section, including links to
  non-Markdown support files. Links elsewhere in the file are ignored.
- Use inline links. Reference-style links in a required section are rejected
  because the mirror cannot see them.
- Opt-in is transitive. Every Markdown file reachable through `includes` must
  itself declare `includes`, so an opted-in entry point has a complete closure.
- Paths are normalized, forward-slash, case-exact, inside the skills root, and
  free of cycles and duplicates.

Markdown remains the runtime authority. The frontmatter is a machine-readable
mirror, not a directive to load every listed file into context. A file with no
`includes` field is ignored entirely, so skills adopt the convention one
closure at a time. Run `node scripts/validate-skill-graph.mjs` to check every
opted-in file.

Agents are standalone `.agent.md` files. Prompt Coach reviews single-prompt
quality; Skill Coach reviews skill package and workflow quality; Simplified
Technical English Coach reviews documentation-production guardrails. Artifact
Roastmaster is a shared non-user-invocable coordinator that roast skills load
as a document rather than invoke directly.

Doctrine files are shared software-engineering industry best practices. Skills
and agents reference only the doctrine relevant to their job; doctrine does
not replace code evidence or repository-specific requirements.

## Using a Skill

Copy a skill package to one of Copilot's recognized locations:

- Personal: `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`
- Repository: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/`

When a copied skill composes a shared unit, copy the `_base/` directory once
beside the installed skills:

- Personal: `~/.agents/skills/_base/`
- Repository: `.github/skills/_base/`

Do not expose `_base` entries as routable skills. If a required unit is missing
at runtime, the consuming skill's own documented degradation behavior applies.

Copy an agent file to `.github/agents/` when it should be available in a repository.

Doctrine-consuming skills require the sibling `doctrine/` directory in the
canonical repository layout. Copying only one roast skill is supported, but it
degrades to `Doctrine status: unavailable`.

For a repository installation, copy doctrine to `.github/doctrine/` beside
`.github/skills/`. For a personal installation, copy it to
`~/.agents/doctrine/` beside `~/.agents/skills/`.

`ship-with-squadron` also requires the separately installed `/handoff` skill.
This repository does not currently ship that external prerequisite.

## Adding Skills

1. Add `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Split substantial instructions into focused files under `references/`.
3. Keep the entry point concise and link every required reference.
4. Run Skill Coach against the complete package; use Prompt Coach for any embedded prompt wording.
5. Preserve applicable licenses and attribution when adapting material from another source.
6. Run `node scripts/validate-skill-graph.mjs` and `node --test scripts/validate-skill-graph.test.mjs`.

Do not use JSON manifests or generated mirrors as the canonical skill format.
