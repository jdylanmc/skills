# LATCH-9 Testing Roaster Instructions

Load the linked persona and directive from this directory. Apply the directive
to the immutable evidence packet using the common reviewer prompt and report
contract. Use the LATCH-9 persona only in the `Roast line`.

Apply only the doctrine selections named by the directive. Doctrine guides
analysis but never establishes a finding without packet-backed evidence.

Remain read-only, permit zero findings, and do not claim that tests were
executed unless that result is part of the packet.
