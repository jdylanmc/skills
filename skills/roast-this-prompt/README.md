# Roast This Prompt

`roast-this-prompt` runs the shared Artifact Roastmaster over one pasted prompt
or one explicitly named prompt file. The Artifact Roastmaster stages that text
as immutable evidence, launches independent read-only roasters, verifies their
evidence, deduplicates root causes, and returns one severity-ranked Artifact
Roast. The prompt is never executed and never rewritten.

## Who this is for

- **Review users** paste one prompt, or name one prompt file, and decide
  whether to use it, revise it, or reroute the work.
- **Prompt authors** read the roast to locate the exact line, the consequence,
  the bounded fix, and the validation that proves the fix.

The report assumes familiarity with prompt-writing practice, not with this
repository. It never edits, commits, publishes, or comments on anything, and it
never returns a revised prompt.

## Terms

- **Roaster** — one independent read-only reviewer instance that applies
  exactly one lens and returns one Artifact Roaster Report.
- **Lens** — the bounded set of review dimensions a roaster applies.
- **Council** — the selected roasters for one run. Maximum five: two mandatory
  and up to three evidence-triggered specialists.
- **Evidence packet** — the immutable staged evidence for one run, named by one
  packet identifier and described by one file manifest with digests. A pasted
  prompt appears as `supplied-text:<packet-id>-<nn>`.
- **Trusted lens document** — a read-only source of review principles, either a
  coach agent file or a bundled lens configuration. Never invoked.
- **Doctrine** — shared engineering best-practice files loaded only through a
  trusted doctrine manifest. Doctrine guides recommendations and never proves a
  defect.

## Pasted prompts

A pasted prompt has no path, so the skill gives it an explicit identity: line
endings are normalized to line feed, the exact bytes are hashed with SHA-256,
and the skill itself holds the exact text across both phases and re-supplies it
to the second, stateless coordinator invocation. It is never written to disk,
and only the cited spans are quoted back. Editing the paste mid-run changes the
digest, so the run returns `Stale evidence` instead of a stale roast.

## Installation

The canonical layout is this skills repository:

```text
agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md
agents/skill-coach.agent.md
agents/prompt-coach.agent.md
agents/ste-coach.agent.md
doctrine/manifest.md
skills/roast-this-prompt/
```

The package also installs standalone at `.github/skills/roast-this-prompt/` or
`~/.agents/skills/roast-this-prompt/`. A standalone install works on its first
run:

- the coordinator resolves to the bundled snapshot at
  `references/agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md`;
- every lens resolves to its bundled configuration in
  `references/30-trusted-lenses.md`;
- shared doctrine is absent, which is a supported state recorded as
  `Doctrine status: unavailable`.

Copying `agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md` and the coach agent files to
`.github/agents/` restores the repository sources, which take precedence over
the bundled copies. Resolution order and integrity rules are in
[Trusted lenses](./references/30-trusted-lenses.md).

## Package layout

```text
skills/roast-this-prompt/
  README.md
  SKILL.md
  references/
    10-prompt-roast-contract.md
    20-failure-and-recovery.md
    30-trusted-lenses.md
    trusted-manifest.md
    agents/
      artifact-roastmaster.agent.md
```

## Maintenance

`references/agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md` is a copy of
`agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md`. After editing the repository agent or
`references/30-trusted-lenses.md`, refresh the copy and regenerate the digests:

```bash
cp agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md \
  skills/roast-this-prompt/references/agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md
shasum -a 256 \
  skills/roast-this-prompt/references/agents/artifact-roastmaster.agent.md \
  skills/roast-this-prompt/references/30-trusted-lenses.md
```

Update the matching entries in
[Trusted manifest](./references/trusted-manifest.md). A stale copy is detected
rather than silently used: the skill prefers the repository agent and records
`Snapshot drift` when the digests disagree.

A run records `Lens drift` when a coach agent in `agents/` no longer matches the
bundled lens configuration in `references/30-trusted-lenses.md`. That is the
trigger to refresh the matching lens section and regenerate its digest with the
command above.

The same maintenance rule applies to the sibling packages `roast-this-skill`
and `roast-this-agent`.
